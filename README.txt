HOW TO USE:

Enter msu login and password, and the class you would like to get in.
If you wish to enroll in CSE 410 Section 2, enter 410 for class id and 002
for section.

*THIS IS HARD CODED FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES, IF YOU WISH TO ENROLL IN A CLASS
NOT IN THE CSE DEPARTMENT, CHANGE EVERY LINE WHERE IT SAYS "CSE: COMPUTER SCIENCE &
ENGINEERING" TO YOUR SPECIFIC SUBJECT AS IT SHOWS ON SCHEDULE.MSU.EDU*


TO DO & FUTURE IDEAS:

-As stated, the script is currently hard coded for CSE classes. In the future I
would like to make it easy to select any subject to enroll. 
-Set up text/email notifications when an open class is found.
